# fAIthfuler

## Overview

The fAIthfuler is an AI-based project aimed at creating high-quality textures with better resolution from lower-resolution Minecraft textures. The goal is to generate textures similar to popular texture packs like Faithful, which provide enhanced visuals while maintaining the essence of the original Minecraft textures.

## Notice

This project is NOT a replacement for Faithful team texture packs. Thanks to them this project exists. If you're willing to generate the texture pack using this tool then you **MUST** use, share or modify it only for private purposes!

## Features

-   Upscale Minecraft textures from lower resolutions (e.g., 16x16) to higher resolutions (e.g., 32x32).
-   Preserve the overall style and aesthetics of popular texture packs like Faithful.
-   Utilize advanced algorithms to enhance the texture quality and details.

## Usage

1. Link the project with your `Minecraft` folder
2. Wait for fAIthfuler to scan the game for metadata
3. Tweak the settings to your liking
4. Click "Generate"
5. Enjoy ðŸŽ‰
